# HitTest-StackView-ReadyToUSe
Based on Lets Build That App YouTube Channel project 
(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA)

This is a different solution where the hitTest is not implemented inside a ViewController but it is a custom view class (UIVIew).
This is a solution "ready-to-use", you just need to copy HitTestView.swift file in your project and 
declare an HitTestView object (setting its properties as you can see in ViewController.swift).
